# AI-Blockchain-IoT-Security-Demo

The AI-Blockchain-IoT-Security Demo is a React-based web application that showcases the integration of multiple cutting-edge technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and Security. Here's an overview of its main components and features:

AI Prediction:

The app includes a simple AI prediction feature.
Users can click a "Predict" button to generate a mock AI prediction.
The prediction simulates demand forecasting, randomly selecting from options like "High demand", "Low demand", or "Moderate demand".
Blockchain Ledger:

There's a basic implementation of a blockchain ledger.
Users can add transactions to the ledger by clicking an "Add Transaction" button.
Each transaction includes a sender (from), recipient (to), amount, and timestamp.
The ledger displays all transactions in a list format.
IoT Sensor Data:

The app simulates IoT sensor data generation.
It uses Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 to create a real-time line chart.
The chart displays the last 10 data points from a simulated sensor.
New data points are added every second, creating a live-updating effect.
Security (Encryption/Decryption):

The application demonstrates basic encryption and decryption using the crypto-js library.
Users can encrypt a predefined message by clicking an "Encrypt" button.
The encrypted data can then be decrypted using a "Decrypt" button.
Both the encrypted and decrypted data are displayed on the screen.
User Interface:

The UI is clean and modern, with a responsive design.
It's divided into four main sections, each representing one of the core technologies.
The app uses a pleasant color scheme with primary colors for headings and buttons.
Each section is visually separated in its own card-like container for clarity.
React and Vite:

The application is built using React for the frontend framework.
It utilizes Vite as the build tool and development server for fast performance.
Styling:

The app uses custom CSS for styling, defined in the src/index.css file.
It employs CSS variables for consistent theming across the application.
This demo serves as an educational tool or proof-of-concept, showcasing how these different technologies can be integrated into a single application. While the implementations are simplified for demonstration purposes, they provide a starting point for understanding how these technologies might work together in more complex, real-world scenarios.
